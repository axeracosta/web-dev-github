        For the next weeks as you alredy know, you will need to practice
        everything that you learned until this point of the course, making by your
        own different websides with different styles.
      </p>
      <p>
        As always you can of course come back to the course and check the videos,
        snapshots or slides in case you need a little help, remember that you also
        have the discord page with all the comunity, if you fell stuck in
        something specific you can always ask there and wait for some to answer
        you.
